                <p style="color:#666; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.6;">ABSTRACT
We study how regulatory competition and learning shape bureaucratic behaviors under regulatory federalism in the US, focusing on Clean Air Act enforcement within intra‐firm networks. Using facility‐level panel data on inspections from 2005 to 2017, we examine how sibling facility violations influence state regulators' scrutiny of focal facilities. These mechanisms predict opposite effects: learning increases scrutiny, while competition decreases it. Our findings provide evidence for both mechanisms, with their relative strength varying under different conditions. Regulators increase scrutiny following violations by same‐state sibling facilities, highlighting strong learning effects when information is accessible and accountability pressures are high. Conversely, scrutiny decreases after violations by same‐industry siblings in competitor states, demonstrating competitive incentives when business opportunities are relevant. These results clarify the interplay between competition...</p>

A Comparative Study of Public and Non‐Public Sector Employees' Perceptions of Discrimination</a></h3>
                <p style="color:#666; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.6;">ABSTRACT
How people are treated in the workplace is of increasing concern, with many scholars arguing that the government, as an employer, should set the standard for equitable treatment. While attention to equity in public administration has grown in research and practice, minimal work has comparatively explored discrimination in the public and non‐public sectors. Drawing on data from the 2018 European Social Survey, this study explores possible differences in how public and non‐public employees perceive discrimination and how perceptions vary across countries. In most countries, the differences between the sectors were not significant, but the findings show that the country, administrative culture, and sociodemographic variables play a role in perceptions of discrimination. This exploratory study makes an important empirical contribution by accumulating evidence of perceptions of discrimination across countries and has practical implications for human resource management practitioner...</p>
