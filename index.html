                <p style="color:#666; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.6;">ABSTRACT
Emerging technologies have far‐reaching effects on public governance. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such technology. Yet, given concerns of privacy, accountability, and bias with AI use, public managers grapple with deciding if, and to what extent, AI should be included in delivering public services. Current research has made attempts to unpack the determinants of AI use in these settings, but with greater focus on the technology rather than its users. The current study shifts focus to citizens' perceptions and asks what the conditions are under which citizens would embrace high‐performing AI government service delivery. The study leverages a sample of 612 U.S. residents in two experiments that investigate public sentiments towards AI in public service contexts where it is implemented well. Findings reveal citizens' nuanced support for AI in simplifying complex programs delivering tailored services and reducing fraud. These insights can guide decision‐making on AI use in...</p>

                <p style="color:#666; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.6;">ABSTRACT
While scholars have built considerable evidence on representative bureaucracy as a transformational independent variable, less is known about the organizational and policy conditions that motivate public institutions to invest in workforce diversity. Drawing on resource dependency theory, we argue that tuition‐free college policies (‘Promise Programs’) will alter organizational incentives by expanding financial resources and diversifying clientele. In turn, we argue that colleges will expand workforce diversity and enhance passive representation of diverse clientele. In our staggered difference‐in‐differences analysis, we find that Promise Programs significantly increased the hiring of Hispanic faculty and staff. However, these gains lagged behind the rapid diversification of the student population, limiting progress toward a representative bureaucracy. These effects were driven by public and two‐year colleges. Our results suggest that Promise Programs can promote workforce di...</p>
